## **Overview of Bike Sharing Analysis**
### Purpose
The purpose of this analysis is to help angel investors see the market potential of a bike sharing venture in Des Moines, Iowa based on a similar business in New York City.  It is hoped that the New York City's bike sharing (Citi Bike) data, being visually represented in Tableau, will persuade the investors to offer seed money to the Des Moines start-up.


## Viz Results

Des Moines is a city with a 2019 estimated population of nearly 700,000 residents and is the largest and most populous city in Iowa with many parks and museums like New York city.

Based on the analsis of Citi Bike data, many of the areas that were frequent start and ending locations for bike share customerers occurred in high tourist areas, near subway entry/exit points, popular parks and museums.  This was noted by the larger circle dimensions in the graphs and by examining the attractions in those zip codes.

The data shows that the bike share customers, who are largely 80% subscribers to the service, are more likely to heavily use this service during the weekdays and weekends.  Weekday usage is relegated to before (6-9am) and after (4-7pm) work hours, with the weekend usage being from 11am to 7pm.  This is positive because the subscribers are repeat customers that use the bike share service in a predictable way.

The data shows a similar usage pattern when broken down on gender between men and women, however men dominate a 65% share of the number of bike trips taken.

## Summary In Brief
This script can be used by the election commission across other multiple counties in the state. They would have to
append more data to the election data set.  They could also include more information by district, zipcode and party
affiliation to give a more robust view of the type of voters that support the candidates.
