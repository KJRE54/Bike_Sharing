## **Overview of Bike Sharing Analysis**
### Purpose
The purpose of this analysis is to help angel investors see the market potential of a bike sharing venture in Des Moines, Iowa based on a similar business in New York City.  It is hoped that the New York City's bike sharing (Citi Bike) data, being visually represented in Tableau, will persuade the investors to offer seed money to the Des Moines start-up.


## Viz Results

Des Moines is a city with a 2019 estimated population of nearly 700,000 residents and is the largest and most populous city in Iowa with many parks and museums like New York city.

### Popular Locations
Based on the analysis of Citi Bike data in the month of August, many of the areas that were frequent start and ending locations for bike share customerers occurred in high tourist areas near subway entry/exit points, popular parks, businesses, shopping areas and museums in mid- to lower Manhattan, NYC. This was noted by the larger dark red circle figures in the map and by examining the attractions in those zip codes.

### Popular Ride Times

The data shows that the bike share customers, who are largely 80% subscribers to the service, are more likely to heavily use this service during the weekdays and weekends.  Weekday usage is relegated to before (6-9am) and after (4-7pm) work hours, with the weekend usage being from 9am to 7pm.  This is positive because the subscribers are repeat customers that use the bike share service in a predictable way.

### Customer Categories

Bike share users exist in 2 segments as Subscriber, a long-term user, and as Customer, a short term user. Based on the researched data, the Subscriber segment is large and is 4.3X larger than the Customer segment. This is good for business, as the Subscriber segment suggests user loyalty, frequent utilization of the service and steady income stream.

## Summary In Brief
TDes Moines' has an estimated population near 700,000. The Midwest city has many of the same attractions like parks and trails, museums and landmarks as well as government and corporate entities where potential working bike share customers would use the service daily. As the data shows, there is high use for the service during the morning and evening weekday rush hour supporting the possibility that users are workers.  The data supports that bike-share destinations are often to popular neighborhoods, museums and parks by analyzing the zipcode locations of the largest bubble map areas. The place, the service, the costs to ride makes Des Moines fertile ground for this entrepreneurial endeavor.
